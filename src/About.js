        Hi everyone, I'm Tung and I am a student and an engineer in Budapest.<br/>
        <br/>
        This blog serves as a platform not just for showcasing my technical endeavors but also for sharing the lens through my stories.
        Let's make it a collaborative space where diverse narratives converge. Whether it's an engineering breakthrough, a personal triumph, or a unique perspective on life, your story matters here. <br/>
        I'm eager to connect with fellow students, and professionals who share an enthusiasm for innovation. We will grow together.
